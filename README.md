# Awesome Go Table
This repo parses the [awesome-go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go) repo and generates a index.html with more useful repo data.

This repo fetches updated info once a week on sunday at 00:00 UTC.

Visit the github pages here:

If you are unhappy with the amount of columns being returned you can download the index.html and add more columns to the javascript.
Or you can make a pull request to this repo and I will consider adding it to the index.
